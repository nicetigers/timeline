    <p>Tasks:</p>
    <pre>
    	Decide how to distribute work among group members
	UI progress:
		Find OSS calendar component
		Make sure it's easy to interface with -- this will feed into decisions re: database schema
		Make sure it's beautiful
		Build sample dashboard page w/ cal items
	Finish database schema
		Map out what queries will be like for main pages, then check to see if this is sane to do with our schema
		Make sure it will play well with the calendar component

    <p>Tasks for next week:</p>

    	Create user authentication system
	Create user profile system -- i.e. once a user logs on, they can sign up for classes and manage the sections they are in

	Put choose-sections functionality into new profile page
	Save prompt is brighter (yellow highlighting)
	All sorts of UI bugfixes for smooth experience
