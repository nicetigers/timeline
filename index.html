    <h2>Weekly updates</h2>
    <h3>Week One</h3>
    <p>Tasks:</p>
    <pre>
    	Decide how to distribute work among group members
	UI progress:
		Find OSS calendar component
		Make sure it's easy to interface with -- this will feed into decisions re: database schema
		Make sure it's beautiful
		Build sample dashboard page w/ cal items
	Finish database schema
		Map out what queries will be like for main pages, then check to see if this is sane to do with our schema
		Make sure it will play well with the calendar component
		Implement database schema in Django models
		If time: manually create some fake data and test the R of CRUD with our new UI
	Query people to see if they would prefer one dashboard or one page per course
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Week Two</h3>
    <p>Accomplished this week: we accomplished the big tasks -- creating our DB schema and a prototype design -- and started implementing the DB schema in Django models</p>
    <p>Tasks for next week:</p>

    	Create user authentication system
	Create user profile system -- i.e. once a user logs on, they can sign up for classes and manage the sections they are in
	Create add event page
	Write script to populate user dashboard with upcoming events -- without integrating into our UI yet
	If we have time, integrate that user dashboard output into our prototype UI
    </pre>

	"Hide" button on events -- i.e. toggle event visibility per user
	Improve profile page to enable name editing and choosing custom sections (besides All Students section)

	Get everyone set up with database migrations
	Modifying events works

	Polling for server-side changes every 10 seconds
	Persisting client-side changes and pushing once every 10 seconds
	Saving dashboard state of open events
	UI tweaks -- better forms and popups, validation for max length of fields, sidebar, various bugfixes

	Find similar events UI
    </pre>
    <p>Tasks for next week:</p>
    <pre>

	AJAX plumbing between "find similar events" backend and frontend
	Once recurring events are finished on backend, update scraper to create events, not just courses and sections
	Color coding
	Finish autocomplete for courses page
	UI niceties -- have help text if there's nothing on your dashboard, create front page before logging in
	Revision approval by users
	Reach out to a prof to beta test with their class
