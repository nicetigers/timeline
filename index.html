      <li><b>02/13/14: </b>Second meeting between the four of us to finalize project choice.</li>

      <li><b>02/25/14: </b>Group meeting to finalize design doc draft and prepare questions for tomorrow's meeting with BWK.</li>
      <li><b>02/26/14: </b>1st meeting with BWK. Discussed draft of design doc, which features to include, how to structure notifications, etc.</li>
      <li><b>03/06/14: </b>Our weekly meeting: finalized design doc with input from meeting with BWK.</li>
      <li><b>03/13/14: </b>Our weekly meeting: set up Heroku and Github. See wiki page in our private Github repository. (The idea is that this timeline repository holds just the timeline, and the private repo holds our code.)</li>
